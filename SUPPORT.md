# Support

How to get help with **kai-gpu-fractioning**. It is community supported by its
[maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md); it does not come with a commercial support contract.

## Where to get help

| I want to… | Go to |
| --- | --- |
| Understand what this does and how to install it | [README.md](README.md) |
| Ask a question, or discuss an idea | The `#kai-scheduler` channel on the [CNCF Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/cloud-native/cncf), which the maintainers of this repository read |
| Report a bug, or request a feature | [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/kai-gpu-fractioning/issues) |
| Report a security vulnerability | **Not an issue** — the private channels in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) |
| Contribute a change | [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) |
| Know who maintains this | [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) |

Maintainers triage issues on a best-effort basis. There is no response-time commitment, but
issues that include the information below get answered fastest.

## What to include in a bug report

- The version of the chart or images you are running, or the commit SHA.
- Kubernetes version and distribution, and the container runtime (containerd or CRI-O) with its
  version — the NRI interface differs between runtime versions.
- NVIDIA driver version and NVIDIA GPU Operator version, and the GPU model.
- The `GpuFractioningConfig` resource, and the pod spec or annotations of the affected workload.
- `kubectl describe` output and logs from the relevant component (`operator`, `fractiond`, `mpsd`
  or `metricsd`), plus the `gpu-fractioning.nvidia.com/Ready` node condition of the affected node.

## Supported versions

Fixes land on `main` and ship in the next release. Only the most recent release is supported;
there is no long-term-support branch for this repository. Security fixes are handled as described
in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

Cluster prerequisites — a supported NVIDIA driver, the NVIDIA GPU Operator and a container
runtime with NRI enabled — are documented in [README.md](README.md); reports against
unsupported prerequisite versions will be closed with a pointer there.
