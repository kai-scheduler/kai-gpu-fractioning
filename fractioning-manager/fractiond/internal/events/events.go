// Package events decouples the ingestion of container lifecycle events from
// their application to storage. Producers (e.g. the NRI plugin handlers) hand the
// Processor an adapter that yields the container→pod mapping and return
// immediately; a single background worker runs each adapter and applies the
// result to a store.Writer in order. The runtime hot path is never blocked and
// create/delete ordering is preserved without locking.
//
// The Processor's API is deliberately free of any runtime (NRI) types: it speaks
// only store.ContainerInfo and the Adapter/SyncAdapter function types. The work
// of turning a runtime-specific event into a store.ContainerInfo — "calculating
// the mapping" — is supplied by the caller as an adapter and executed on the
// worker goroutine, so even that conversion stays off the producer's hot path.
// The writer in production is the filesystem mapping store (internal/fsstore),
// but the Processor depends only on the store.Writer interface and neither knows
// nor cares how the mapping is persisted.
