# GOFIPS140 is threaded through each Dockerfile individually, so a component
# built without its build arg would publish a "-fips" image containing ordinary
# crypto. The component list is therefore read from the Makefile rather than
# kept here, so a component that is built but not verified fails the drift
# check below instead of being skipped. Only the in-image binary paths live
# here, since nothing else knows them.
