## [Unreleased]

### Added
- CNCF project-repository requirements, ahead of making the repository public in
  the `kai-scheduler` organization: `GOVERNANCE.md` (this repository's own
  governance — its maintainers, decision making, and how that group changes),
  `MAINTAINERS.md`, `ADOPTERS.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and
  `LICENSE-docs` (CC-BY-4.0) alongside the Apache-2.0 `LICENSE`, per CNCF
  Charter section 11. `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` now explicitly adopts the CNCF Code
  of Conduct and names <conduct@cncf.io> as an escalation path, and the README
  references it, carries the CNCF footer and the LF Projects
  copyright/trademark notice, and states the dual code/docs licensing.
- Open-source compliance plumbing ahead of the public release: `CLA.md`
  (Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1), `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, a generated
  `THIRD-PARTY.txt` covering the 92 third-party Go modules linked into the
  shipped binaries (also shipped in every image at `/THIRD-PARTY.txt`), and the
  Apache-2.0 SPDX header on every authored file. `make license-check` and
  `make third-party-check` enforce both in CI.
- metricsd metric names are now configurable via Helm (`metricsAgent.metricNames.{gpuMemoryUsedBytes,gpuSmUtilizationPercent,gpuSmUtilizationPercentNormalized}`), and the per-pod metric labels are `namespace, pod, pod_uuid, gpu_uuid, gpu` (renamed from `pod_uid`/`gpu_index`) to integrate with external metric consumers.
- New `sm-sharing` GPU compute-sharing mode, selected per-container via `nvidia.com/container.<container-name>.gpu-compute.mode: "time-slicing" | "sm-sharing"` (defaults to `time-slicing`, today's unchanged behavior). mpsd runs a second, parameterless MPS server (`context-share` enabled, with the default socket excluded from context sharing so only containers routed to the shared server share a context — time-slicing containers keep the default socket and their memacct-enforced memory limits) alongside the default one; fractiond routes a container annotated `sm-sharing` to that shared server's socket instead, so its GPU compute is shared via MPS (concurrent SM occupancy) rather than time-sliced. Any other annotation value — including a present-but-empty one — fails container creation (or falls back to `time-slicing` under fail-open). The whole feature is gated by a new installation-time Helm value, `supportSmSharing` (defaults to `true`); disabling it reverts to pre-feature behaviour without a code rollback — mpsd reverts to its pre-feature MPS config and daemon invocation (the shared server and its required multiuser mode both go away) and fractiond rejects the `sm-sharing` annotation like any other invalid value. The toggle applies to containers created afterwards and does not migrate running ones, so stop sm-sharing workloads and confirm the shared server has no clients before disabling it.

### Changed
- All four images now build from an NVIDIA-approved base container. `operator`,
  `fractiond` and `metricsd` move from `gcr.io/distroless/*` to
  `nvcr.io/nvidia/distroless/go:v4.0.8`; `mpsd` stays on the approved public
  `nvidia/cuda` base. No OS packages are added on top of any base. The operator
  container now runs as uid **1000** (the base image's `nvs` user) instead of
  65532, and `fractiond` and `metricsd` set `USER 0:0` explicitly because the
  new base defaults to a non-root user and both need root (the NRI socket and
  NVML respectively).
- The minimum supported NVIDIA GPU Operator version is now **v26.7.1** (was v26.7.0). A cluster running v26.7.0 is reported as unsupported on the `GpuFractioningConfig` `Ready` condition and the node-level daemons are not rolled out. Note that a ClusterPolicy labelled only `26.7` normalizes to `v26.7.0` and is therefore also rejected; label it with the full patch version.

### Fixed
- The mpsd pod now runs with `hostPID: true`, without which MPS memory accounting could not register any client and GPU memory limits went unenforced. The MPS control daemon identifies a client by the PID in its socket's peer credentials, and the kernel only translates that PID for the daemon's own PID namespace or a descendant of it; from inside its own pod namespace mpsd therefore saw every workload container as pid 0, logged `[memacct] failed to register client pid 0`, and attributed memory-accounting events to `target=unknown`. The host PID namespace is an ancestor of every container's, so PIDs and their cgroups now resolve. Workloads require no change.
- fractiond now defaults a missing GPU-memory request or limit from the other (so `request == limit`). A container that annotates only `.request` now also gets `NVIDIA_GPU_MEMORY_LIMITS` injected (enforced at the requested size instead of being unbounded), and a container that annotates only `.limit` gets `NVIDIA_GPU_MEMORY_REQUESTS` populated. The retroactive-enforcement audit applies the same defaulting.
